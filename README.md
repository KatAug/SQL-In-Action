It appears that reviews have a lot to do with the succes of an AirBnB rental in this market. Williamsburg and Harlem seem to be the two most desirable areas since they both appeared 16 times in the neighbourhood column. Out of the 16 in Williamsburg, most of those AirBnB's were enitre home rentals and for Harlem it was mostly private room rentals.
